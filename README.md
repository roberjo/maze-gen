# Procedural Maze Generator

A visually engaging maze generation and solving visualization tool that combines procedural generation with real-time animation and AI pathfinding.

## 🌟 Features

- **Procedural Maze Generation**
  - Multiple generation algorithms (Depth-First Search, Prim's, Kruskal's)
  - Customizable maze size and complexity
  - Real-time generation visualization

- **Visual Effects**
  - Smooth cell-by-cell generation animation
  - Dynamic lighting and shadows
  - Ambient particle effects
  - Color themes and visual customization

- **AI Pathfinding**
  - Real-time maze solving visualization
  - Multiple solving algorithms (A*, Dijkstra's, Breadth-First)
  - Step-by-step path visualization
  - Performance metrics and statistics

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Frontend**
  - HTML5 Canvas for rendering
  - JavaScript/TypeScript for logic
  - Modern CSS for UI components
  - WebGL for advanced visual effects (optional)

- **Development Tools**
  - Node.js for development environment
  - Vite for build tooling
  - ESLint for code quality
  - Jest for testing
